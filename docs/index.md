# Scripty 
## A Text Editor for ChromeOS


### A Coding on a ChromeBook
An Open-Source IDE for ChromeOS by Jaden Arceneaux. This project was created due to a distinct lack of good IDEs for ChromeOS. The goal of Scripty is to supplement this problem. Scripty takes advantage of the built-in Linux sandbox in Chrome Books to provide the best coding experience on ChromeOS.
