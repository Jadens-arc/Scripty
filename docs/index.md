An Open-Source IDE for ChromeOS by Jaden Arceneaux. This project was created due to a distinct lack of good IDEs for ChromeOS. The goal of Scripty is to supplement this problem. Scripty takes advantage of the built-in Linux sandbox in Chrome Books to provide the best coding experience on ChromeOS.

# Requirements:

  - Tkinter (will automatically install on run)
  - OS (built in Python module)

  - Time (built in Python module)
  - Threading  (built in Python module)
  - Linux (not tested for Windows or macOS)

# Usage:
```
cd Scripty
python3 Scripty.py
or
python3 Scripty.py [Your File]
